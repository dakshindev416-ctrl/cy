# introduction to information security and cybersecurity 
## information security 
Information security
- Protection of *all form of information* (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.
- Broader - includes *data in any form* (printed, spoken, written, or electronic).
- Ensure *Confidentiality, Intergrity and availability (CIA)* of information, regardless of medium.
- Data protection (physical and digital).
- paper documents
  
  Cyber security
  
- Protection of *digital assets, systems, networks, and data* from cyberattacks originating through the internet or  other digital means.
- Narrower - focuses specifically on *digital and network-based threats*
- Protect *computers, networks, servers, and data* from online attacks, breaches and malware.
- system and network defense (digital only)

## simplified understanding
- information security = protecting all kinds of information
- digital + physical

- in short
- cybersecurity is a subtract.

## Example comparison
| *Situation*                                        | *Infosec View*                                                | *Cybersecurity view*
| ---------------------------------------------        | ------------------------------------------------------------    | --------------------------------------------------- 
| A hacker steals customer database from a website     | Concerned about *loss of confidentiality* of customer data    | Concerned about *how the hacker breached the server* and *network vulnerabilities*
| Employee prints confidential data and leaks it       | *Handled under Infosec* (physical data breach)                | Not considered a *cyber* issue (no digital attack involved)
